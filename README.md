NBA StatStream
=================
This is the README for my first Android application: NBA StatStream.
-----------------
*This app is in no way affliated with the NBA or the NBA's official app. It simply serves as a first app that I have developmented.*
*I'm just a huge NBA fan.*

This app shows all the NBA games for a given day, and allows the user to get box scores, stats, and advanced stats for a given game once it completed.
